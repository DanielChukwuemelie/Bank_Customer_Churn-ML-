This repository encompasses data preparation, exploratory data analysis. It imports essential libraries and modules, conducts data parsing and numeric conversion, addressing missing data issues. Two classification models, XGB Classifier and Logistic Regression, are explored and fine-tuned, with Logistic Regression outperforming them..
This repository houses an in-depth data analysis and classification project that focuses on delivering insights and predictive modeling. We've meticulously followed a structured approach to ensure robust results:

Data Preparation: We've meticulously cleaned and prepared the dataset, making it ready for analysis. This step is crucial to ensure that the data is in a format suitable for machine learning.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We've performed comprehensive exploratory data analysis, diving into the dataset's characteristics, distributions, and patterns. EDA helps in understanding the underlying data and can reveal crucial insights.

Data Visualization: Visualizing data can provide a clearer understanding of the dataset. We've used various visualization techniques to represent the data visually, aiding in better interpretation.

Library Import: To support our project, we've imported the necessary libraries and modules required for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. Having the right tools is essential for efficient project execution.

Data Parsing and Numeric Conversion: We've tackled the challenge of parsing data and converting non-numeric values into numeric ones. This is often necessary for machine learning models that require numeric input features.

Handling Missing Data: Missing data can lead to issues in model performance. We've diligently filled in missing data to prevent any adverse effects on model accuracy, particularly in the context of confusion matrices.

Model Selection: In our project, we've explored two classification models: XGB Classifier and Logistic Regression. These models offer different approaches to classification tasks.

Training and Fine-Tuning: We've trained these models using the available data. Additionally, we've applied hyperparameter tuning to optimize their performance. This step is crucial for achieving the best possible accuracy without overfitting.

Model Comparison: Finally, we evaluated both models' performance and found that Logistic Regression outperformed the XGB Classifier after hyperparameter tuning. This selection was made based on the model's ability to achieve higher performance while avoiding overfitting.

This repository serves as a valuable resource for those interested in data analysis, classification modeling, and the intricacies of fine-tuning models for optimal performance. It provides a detailed account of the steps involved in a data-driven project and showcases the practical application of machine learning in real-world scenarios.
